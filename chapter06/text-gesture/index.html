        <p>This web page responds to gesture events only, so make sure to
        view this on a device with a multitouch display.</p>
        
        <p>"Pinching" a paragraph will increase and decrease its font
        size.  Rotating two fingers on a paragraph will change its opacity
        (think of it like turning an "opacity knob").</p>
        
        <p>Note how rotation and scaling may change simultaneously.
        Thus, in practice it is typically less confusing for the user
        if a gesture-capable web page sets up its event handlers so that
        changes are made according to just scaling or just rotation.</p>
